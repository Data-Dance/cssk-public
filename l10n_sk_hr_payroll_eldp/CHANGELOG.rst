Unreleased
~~~~~~~~~~

* Relicensed to **AGPL-3**. Part of a repository-wide move to a single licence:
  everything Data Dance authors is AGPL-3 except the modules that depend on Odoo
  Enterprise, which OEEL forbids from carrying it. What differs between modules
  is now whether they are published, not how they are licensed.

19.0.1.0.1 (2026-07-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Normalized all user-facing strings to clean English (removed mixed-language
  parentheticals). Added a Slovak (``i18n/sk.po``) translation and the
  extraction template (``i18n/<module>.pot``).

19.0.1.0.0 (2026-07-05)
-----------------------

* Initial release: annual Slovak ELDP (Evidenčný list dôchodkového poistenia),
  one ``eldpZec`` per employee with the year's pension assessment base and
  insured period, validated against the official ``ELDP-v2015_1.3.xsd``.
* Reuses the engine-neutral payslip adapter over a whole-year period; the
  pension base ``vzDP`` is derived from the summed GROSS.

[19.0.1.0.2] — 2026-09-13
-------------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- **Terms the translation catalogue never carried.** Strings that reach the
  user were absent from the template — a field with no ``string=``, a mixin
  field addressed to the abstract model's ``ir.model.fields`` row rather
  than each concrete one, or a whole category the offline exporter never
  emitted. An absent term cannot be translated and shows English in an
  otherwise Slovak screen. The template and the catalogues now carry them,
  and the Slovak is written.
